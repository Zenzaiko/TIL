# Mathematics(2B)

Today, I worked through the mathematics text book up to the beginning of Chapter 2 (p.38).

## Arithmetic mean and Geometric mean Inequality

The arithmetic mean of two non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to their geometric mean.

Moreover, when a = b, the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean are equal.

## Complex numbers

For the discriminant D of a quadratic equation:

- When D > 0, there are two distinct real roots.
- When D = 0, there is one real double root.
- When D < 0, there are two distinct complex roots.
