# Quantum computing

I went to the library called "Toritsu Chuou Toshokan" in Tokyo to study.

I learned the essential foundational knowledge for understanding quantum computing.

It includes:

- Classical computing concepts
- Quantum mechanics
- Linear algebra
- Probability theory and complex numbers

I bought a mathematics book for high school students but I'm not a high school student.
